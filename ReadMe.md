## How to run <br>
  1: Compile s1, s2, s4, c and proxy.cpp <br>
  2: In separate terminals, run the executables of all server files in this order s1 -> s2 -> s4 -> proxy <br>
  3: Again in separate terminals, run the client executable. For multiple clients, run the same executable in different terminals <br>
  4: Select whatever you wish the clients to do <br> <br>
  
<b> Doesn't require anything more than a C++ compiler and a shell </b>
